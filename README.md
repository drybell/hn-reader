# Hacker News Client

## Overview

A client wrapper of [Hacker News][news.yc] using their public [API][hn-api]. Currently starting with a flask/fastapi-based backend with an eventual typescript/react frontend.

## Rationale

I'm fed up with using HN apps and want to build something that let's me do the following:

1. Story/Job Analysis
2. Cross-Device Sync
3. Personal Recommendations & Filters
4. ???
